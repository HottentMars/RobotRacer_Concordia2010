Racinator is an autonomous racing robot that can navigate and race on a track that is bordered by two lines of black electrical tape. The Racinator has abilities to recognize the environment of the track; avoiding obstacles on its way and detecting which way to turn and follow. The robot is driven by Atmega8 Microcontroller that is loaded with a high level of C programming software. The robot uses a Quad Dual H-Bridge to control four GM 6 motors. And also, the Racinator uses 6xAA battery to supply power to the Atmega8 Microcontroller and the Quad Dual H-Bridge.
